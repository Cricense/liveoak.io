= LiveOak is Live!
Bob McWhirter & Boles≈Çaw Dawidowicz

We are proud to announce first public alpha release of link:http://liveoak.io[LiveOak] - a fully opensource MBaaS solution from
link:http://redhat.com[Red Hat].

== What is MBaaS?

Mobile Backend as a Service enables rapid application development by providing key backend services out of the box.
All easily configurable, secured and exposed with REST endpoints.

== Which services exactly?

link:http://liveoak.io[LiveOak] provides storage service, currently based on link:http://www.mongodb.org/[MongoDB].
However, we plan to support other databases and NoSQL solutions
 as well in the future. It's exposed through REST endpoints and provides access to rich query capabilities.
 Applications can use subscriptions based on WebSockets (or native mobile push, see below) to get notifications
 about updates to content in storage services.

Here's a good example of how easy it is to create a simple application by leveraging storage and subscriptions with
link:http://liveoak.io[LiveOak]:

Security is another key aspect of a BaaS solution. link:http://liveoak.io[LiveOak] integrates and embeds link:http://keycloak.org[Keycloak].
link:http://keycloak.org[Keycloak] is a fully fledged authentication and authorization server built on top of OAuth2 and JSON Web
Token (JWT) specifications. link:http://liveoak.io[LiveOak] also provides a flexible policy framework, with built in URL and ACL based
policies to cover most use-cases. This makes it easy to secure REST endpoints out of the box, and also provides extensibility if needed.

In order to support native push capabilities across different mobile platforms, such as iOS and Android,
link:http://liveoak.io[LiveOak] integrates link:http://aerogear.org/docs/specs/aerogear-server-push/[AeroGear's UnifiedPush Server (UPS)].
Through link:http://aerogear.org/docs/specs/aerogear-server-push/[UPS] developers are able to configure, and register
mobile applications, route and filter the sending of native push messages using a fully REST based API, its native SDKs,
 and their link:http://cordova.apache.org/[Cordova] plugin. The link:http://aerogear.org/docs/specs/aerogear-server-push/[UPS] also has its own administrative
 console that integrates link:http://keycloak.org[Keycloak]. Look for more
 integration with link:http://aerogear.org/[AeroGear] in the future as well.

Important aspect of link:http://liveoak.io[LiveOak] is that everything is exposed as proper REST endpoints. We
aim to provide developers with clean and well thought out APIs.

On top of all of this we provide a powerful and extensive Management Console UI. It was designed from the ground up with
 usability in mind. However you are not forced to use it. We aim to expose all management operations via a proper REST API.

== Cloud

link:http://liveoak.io[LiveOak] has been designed from the beginning as a first class citizen for cloud infrastructure. We provide an
link:https://openshift.redhat.com/[OpenShift]
 cartridge, and a link:https://www.docker.io/[Docker] image should be available soon.

== How can I try it out?

First of all check out our link:http://liveoak.io/[website]. You can find several link:/docs[screencasts], link:/docs[getting started guides and tutorials] there.

link:http://liveoak.io[LiveOak] also comes with few link:/docs/guides/guide_examples/[example applications] that can be quickly tried out.
We have a simple link:/docs/guides/tutorial_chat/[chat application], our
 own variant of the well known link:/docs/guides/tutorial_todomvc[TodoMVC application] and a link:/docs/guides/tutorial_gallery[gallery application]
 showing binary storage capabilities. All of these are also available as Android applications - either native or link:http://cordova.apache.org/[Cordova].

link:/docs/guides/tutorial_chat/#preparing-chat-android-app-for-buil[Android chat client] deserves a special mention as it demonstrates integration with
link:http://aerogear.org/docs/specs/aerogear-server-push/[AeroGear Unified Push Server] to receive
native push notifications.

== What are your plans for the future?

We have plenty of ideas. A few key ones:

* Custom business logic.
* More storage options
* API usage metrics and basic analytics
* Many new Management Console capabilities
* SDKs and tooling
* Better provisioning and automation
