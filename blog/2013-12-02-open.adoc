= And We're Open!
Bob McWhirter

Welcome to the LiveOak (m)BaaS project. LiveOak
aims to become a great and useful backend-as-a-service
project that'll allow you to easily create mobile (and
non-mobile) applications without having to care too much
about the server-side.

Unlike some other mBaaS solutions, LiveOak is a project
from Red Hat, with the intention of running both hosted
(through facilities such as OpenShift) and on-premise.

As with everything Red Hat, LiveOak is an open-source project
under a friendly license.

Please feel free to keep in touch and check the code regularly.
We are still in very early days, so there is currently no
released distribution, but that's coming soon.
