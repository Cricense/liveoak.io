        LiveOak is an open source project. We love contributors.
        If you'd like to be a part of the project, all it takes 
        to get started is checking out the code from:
        %pre
          %code
            https://github.com/liveoak-io/liveoak.git

      %p
        This website itself is also a community effort,
        which can be improved using Awestruct.  You can
        checkout the entire website:
        %pre
          %code
            https://github.com/liveoak-io/liveoak.io.git

      %h3 Mailing List
      %p
        Here's where we communicate asynchronously

      %h3 IRC
      %p
        The development team routinely hangs out in
        the <code>#liveoak</code> channel on 
        <code>irc.freenode.net</code>
