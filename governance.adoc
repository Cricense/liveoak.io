name and logo are trademarks of Red Hat.

== Project Governance

The LiveOak project is operated as a community-centric open-source project.  While
Red Hat product-management has a voice, it is akin to the same voice of any member
of the community, whether they contribute code, bug-reports, bug-fixes or documentation.

To participate in the project in any capacity, please join the project mailing-list
or IRC channels.
