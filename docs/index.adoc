=== Getting LiveOak

LiveOak is all about making it easier to develop mobile client applications by providing ready made, easy to consume cloud services that most mobile applications today require.

LiveOak can be deployed locally on a developer machine, or in the cloud - either to OpenShift Online or as a Docker container.

For this guide weâ€™ll use a local installation which can be downloaded from link:../downloads[http://liveoak.io/downloads].
