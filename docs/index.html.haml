          %h3 Getting LiveOak
          %p LiveOak is all about making it easier to develop mobile client applications by providing ready made, easy to consume cloud services that most mobile applications today require.
          %p LiveOak can be deployed locally on a developer machine, or in the cloud - there is an example available for deploying it to OpenShift Online.
          %p
            For this guide we’ll use a local installation which can be downloaded from
            = succeed "." do
              %a{:href => "#{site.base_url}/downloads"} http://liveoak.io/downloads
          %h3 Installing and Running LiveOak
          %p It’s very easy to get started with LiveOak.
          %p
            Start by unpacking the downloaded binary
            %code .zip
            or
            %code .tgz
            archive, which will create a
            %code liveoak
            directory on your disk. We’ll refer to this directory as
            = succeed "." do
              %code $LIVEOAK_HOME
          %p All you have to do now is run it:
          %pre
            %code $LIVEOAK_HOME/bin/standalone.sh -b 0.0.0.0
          %p The second parameter is there to make the server socket accessible on all the network interfaces, so you can connect to LiveOak from your mobile device or an emulator.
          %p
            LiveOak requires Java 8. You can test your
            %code java
            version by running:
          %pre
            %code java -version
          %p
            If you don’t have Java 8 on your system, follow the instructions
            %a{:href => "/docs/guides/installing_java"} here
            to install it.
          %p
            When LiveOak is started for the first time it will look for any existing MongoDB on your system. If it doesn’t find one, it will automatically download
            %code MongoDB
            from
            = succeed "," do
              %a{:href => "http://mongodb.org"} mongodb.org
            %code $HOME/.liveoak/mongo
            directory, it will then continue booting up.
          %p
            Downloading
            %code MongoDB
            takes a while, otherwise LiveOak itself starts up in just a few seconds.
          %p
            Once LiveOak is started, point your browser to
            = succeed "." do
              %a.bare{:href => "http://localhost:8080"} http://localhost:8080
          %p
            You should get a simple page listing the currently available LiveOak applications. For a start, there is ‘admin’ application which contains
            = succeed "." do
              %a{:href => "http://localhost:8080/admin"} LiveOak Admin Console
          %p
            %a{:href => "http://localhost:8080/admin"} LiveOak Admin Console
            requires you to log in. Use
            %code admin
            as username, and password. The first time you log in you’ll be prompted to change the password.
          %p
            %a{:href => "http://localhost:8080/admin"} LiveOak Admin Console
            has quite a short idle timeout, so you may have to login again quite often.
          %p

            , to see how easy it is.
