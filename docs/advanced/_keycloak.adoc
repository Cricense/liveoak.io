=== External Keycloak

link:http://keycloak.org[Keycloak] is used by LiveOak to handle security and authentication of users. By default, LiveOak contains
an embedded Keycloak instance to enable the admin console and examples to work without much additional effort. However, in some
cases, you may need to use a separate Keycloak instance instead of the embedded one. In this case, you can follow these instructions:

We assume that LiveOak will be running on http://localhost:8080 and your separate Keycloak instance will be running on
http://localhost:8081. Though there is nothing preventing LiveOak and Keycloak from being on different hosts and ports, this is
only the example configuration that has been chosen.

==== Keycloak setup

If you don't already have a separate Keycloak instance running, follow the
http://docs.jboss.org/keycloak/docs/1.1.0.Beta2/userguide/html/server-installation.html[User Guide] to install it.

Once Keycloak is started, login as `admin` into the Keycloak admin console and go to
http://localhost:8081/auth/admin/master/console/#/realms/master/applications. Then click `Add Application` and add an application like this:

* Name: `console`
* Access type: `public`
* 2 redirect URIs with values http://localhost:8080/admin and http://localhost:8080/admin/
* Then click `Save` button

Now when Application is created, you can configure:

* Base URL: http://localhost:8080/admin/
* Web origins: http://localhost:8080

Then you need to create `liveoak-apps` realm:

* Go to http://localhost:8081/auth/admin/master/console/#/realms/master and click on `Add Realm`
* Enter the name `liveoak-apps`, and click `Save`
* On page http://localhost:8081/auth/admin/master/console/#/realms/liveoak-apps/login-settings you may need to check `User Registration`
to enable registration of new users in `liveoak-apps` realm

==== LiveOak setup

First delete file `$LIVEOAK_HOME/standalone/deployments/auth-server.war` and `$LIVEOAK_HOME/standalone/deployments/auth-server.war.dodeploy`
to ensure that the embedded Keycloak is no longer deployed within LiveOak.

Then edit file `$LIVEOAK_HOME/apps/admin/console/js/app.js` and change particular part of the file when `liveOak` object is configured
to look like this:

[source]
var liveOak = new LiveOak({
  auth: {
    url: 'http://localhost:8081/auth',
    realm: 'master',
    clientId: 'console',
    onload: 'login-required'
  }
});

Also edit file `$LIVEOAK_HOME/conf/extensions/keycloak.json` and edit `keycloak-url` property to look like:

[source]
keycloak-url: 'http://localhost:8081/auth',

After doing these, you can go to http://localhost:8080/admin and enjoy LiveOak admin console secured by external Keycloak from localhost:8081.

==== Securing LiveOak applications

In most cases, you just need to follow the README for each application. There is not much difference between the default setup (embedded Keycloak)
and external Keycloak. Things to keep in mind are:

* In your application, you need to change the place where liveOak object is created and add the property `url` to the `auth` part.
The line with the value of property URL will be like this:
[source]
url: 'http://localhost:8081/auth',

For example in `chat-html-secured` application, you need to add the line here
https://github.com/liveoak-io/liveoak-examples/blob/master/chat/chat-html-secured/app/chat.js#L8 so the whole part with `auth` object
will look like this:

[source]
auth: {
  url: 'http://localhost:8081/auth',
  clientId: 'chat-html-secured-client',
  realm: 'liveoak-apps'
}

Similarly for other example application. Most example applications are designed in a way that creation of liveOak object is at only one place.
So you need to change just this one place.

* Make sure that when you're creating a client, you won't use relative redirect URI like `/chat-html-secured/\*` but you will always use redirect URIs with whole
domain part like for example `http://localhost:8080/chat-html-secured/*`. Relative URI can only be used in the situation where Keycloak
and LiveOak are on the same host, which is not the case with external Keycloak.

* Make sure that when you're creating a client, you will always configure Web Origins with the LiveOak host. Usually the value of Web Origin will be `http://localhost:8080`.
Web Origins are normally not needed with default setup (embedded Keycloak) as in that case both LiveOak and Keycloak have the same origin.
But with external Keycloak, you always need to add Web Origin. See details link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing[here].
