== Server Side Scripting

=== Overview

LiveOak provides the ability for application developers to write and administer their own javascript based logic within the LiveOak server.

These scripts allow the application developer to access to such things as:

* Inspecting the incoming request and outgoing response
* Modifying the request and response
* Denying the request or response
* Accessing any of the LiveOak resources. This allows for such things as reading and writing to the LiveOak storage. As well as configuring any of the internal LiveOak resources (such as security or UPS integration).

=== Resource Triggered Scripts

These scripts can be configured to be triggered before and/or after any resource invocation. This include when a resource is created, read,
updated or deleted. Or if an error occured during the invocation. These resource triggered scripts are useful for such things as:

* Verifying that incoming data is properly formated and of an expected type
* Acting as a highly customized gatekeeper to resources
* Modifying the incoming requests to add such things as metadata to the resource
* Modifying the outgoing response to add or remove content going out to a specific user

=== Getting Started

==== Scripting Examples

The easiest way to get started with LiveOak server side scripting is to try out the examples.

From the LiveOak console, click on 'Applications' and then on 'Try example applications'. If you are running locally on port 8080, then the url to install the example applications is http://localhost:8080/admin#/example-applications

===== Hello Script Example
The 'message' example is a very simple example to go through and print a message to the server logs whenever a resource is accessed.
More information about this example can be found at https://github.com/liveoak-io/liveoak-example-helloscript

===== Metadata Example
The 'Metadata for Data' example will add a 'last-modified' entry to new storage data being created, as well as remove this entry when a normal user access it.
More information about this example can be found at https://github.com/liveoak-io/liveoak-example-metadatascript

===== Data Validation Example
The 'Data Validation' example will enforce a specific format when creating a new 'product' entry into the LiveOak storage.
More information about this example can be found at https://github.com/liveoak-io/liveoak-example-formatscript

===== Useragent Example
The 'Request Headers' example will fetch the useragent of the device accessing the resource and store it in a resource collection.
More information about this example can be found at https://github.com/liveoak-io/liveoak-example-useragentscript

==== Starting from Scratch

It is very easy to add resource triggered scripts to your application. Just select the 'Logic' option from the left side menu in your application overview page and select 'New Script'

=== Configuring Scripts

From within the console, when you create or go to edit a script, you will be presented with a form to configure your script.

image::scripting/new_script.png[Console Script Configuration, 90%, align="center"]


The various settings for script configuration are:

Script ID::
The indentifier for this script. This values can only be set on script creation

Resource Path::
The path we should should target our script against. See the <<Resource Paths>> section for more information.

Priority::
Sets the priority for running this script when multiple scripts are configured to be triggered against the same resource path. The higher the priority, the sooner the script will be run.

Enable Script::
If the script should be currently enabled or not

Script Name::
An optional, user friendly name for the script.

Description::
An optional description to be used for the script.

==== Resource Paths
The resource path for your script determines what resources should trigger the script. You can use the resource path to target one particular resource, all the children of a particular resource, all the descendants of a particular resource, or a combination of these options.

You can only specify one resource path per script. You will need to create multiple scripts if you need the same script to be run against multiple targets.

.Example Resource Paths
[align="center",cols="1,^2",options="header",valign="top"]
|===================================
|Resource Path | Resource Target

|/test/storage/dogs/fido | Targets just the 'fido' resource

|/test/storage/dogs/* | Targets any resource in the 'dogs' collection

|/test/storage/dogs* | Targets any resource in the 'dogs' collection as well as any direct access to the 'dogs' resource itself. This is equivalent to having two resource paths which point to '/test/storage/dog' and '/test/storage/dog/*'

|/test/storage/* | Targets all resources in the storage collection. But does not target any descendants of those resources. This means that '/test/storage/dogs' will trigger the script, but '/test/storage/dogs/fido' will not.

|/test/storage/** | Targets all resource in the storage collection and all their descendants. This means that '/test/storage/dogs' will trigger the script, as well as '/test/storage/dogs/fido' and such things as '/test/storage/dogs/fido/owner'

|/test/storage* | This is equivalent to having two resource paths which point to '/test/storage/*' and '/test/storage'

|/test/storage** | This is equivalent to having two resource paths which point to '/test/storage/**' and '/test/storage'

|===================================

==== The Script

What functions your script contains will determine what actions will trigger the script into being run.

For example, if your *Resource Path* is _/test/storage/dogs/fido_ and your script contains a *preUpdate(link:/docs/advanced/javascript_api/Request.html[request^])* function, then this function will be called whenever an update is about to be performed on the _/test/storage/dogs/fido_ resource.

Similarily, if you also had a *postUpdate(link:/docs/advanced/javascript_api/Response.html[response^])* function, then this function would be called after the update had occured.

You can have multiple script functions defined in your script, and each will be run based on the appropriate action.
