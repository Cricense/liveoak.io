LiveOak comes with a set of examples, that demonstrate how to develop web, and mobile applications using LiveOak services.
Chat application comes in two forms - as a simple web application, and as an Android native mobile application.

Both of these are non-trivial applications in terms of backend services they use, but with LiveOak these services are provided out-of-the-box.
The developer only has to configure the services, and use them. There is no application specific server-side code involved. That means the
developer can focus on the client where interaction with the user happens, while the server part is already done.

Services demonstrated in this example are LiveOak MongoDB backed storage service, static files serving service, WebSockets based subscriptions APIs
to get notifications about new content, cloud messaging push services, and basic security services.



== Chat HTML Application

This is a perfect application to try out LiveOak server and start exploring its capabilities.


Let’s start by unpacking LiveOak examples .zip archive from link:http://liveoak.io/downloads[LiveOak Downloads page].
That will create a directory called `liveoak-examples` which we'll refer to as $LIVEOAK_EXAMPLES.

Copy `$LIVEOAK_EXAMPLES/chat/chat-html` directory to `$LIVEOAK/apps` directory - next to existing `admin` directory.

Restart LiveOak server (use CTRL-C), and visit link:http://localhost:8080[] again.

You should now see a new application next to `admin` in the application list. Click on it.

You should see a simple chat web application. Enter some text as if you were Alice.

image::guides/chat_html.png[Chat HTML]


Open the url in another window, side by side with the first, and type something in there and send it.
You should see the sent text display in both windows instantly.

`chat-html` is a link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application[single page web application] - it provides static html,
javascript, css content which is served by LiveOak as simple static files. This is configured through LiveOak
link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liveoak-io/liveoak-examples/master/chat/chat-html/application.json[application.json] configuration
file which instructs LiveOak what ready-made services to expose through REST for this application.

Serving static files is one of these services. Another one is persistent storage backed by `MongoDB`.

Keep in mind that `chat-html` doesn’t contain any application specific server-side logic - all the javascript files are for client browser,
not for the server, yet the application stores chat messages on the server, and broadcasts content updates to other clients through server.
All thanks to out-of-the-box services that LiveOak provides.

We can use link:http://localhost:8080/admin[LiveOak Admin Console] to configure application resources, and browse application data on the server.
Let’s go to link:http://localhost:8080/admin[]

Log in as user `admin` - the first time you try to login to link:http://localhost:8080/admin[LiveOak Admin Console] you will be asked to set a new password.

image::guides/chat_html_admin_dashboard.png[Chat HTML - Admin Dashboard]


You should now find yourself on `Dashboard` page for `chat-html` application.

To browse application data select `Storage` in the left navigation bar.

image::guides/chat_html_admin_storage.png[Chat HTML - Admin Storage]


We can see that we have one storage resource configured, bound to `/storage` subroot of `/chat-html`, and using `MongoDB` at `localhost:27017`.

Where did this configuration come from?
It is specified in `$LIVEOAK/apps/chat-html/application.json` file which serves as a master configuration file for the application.

We can create storage resources directly through link:http://localhost:8080/admin[LiveOak Admin Console] as well, but for now let's browse
through `chat-html` application’s data created thus far.

Click on storage resource title text `storage` - in green.

image::guides/chat_html_admin_storage_collections.png[Chat HTML - Admin Storage Collections]

We can browse the data, and search through it. If we switch again to application page, and send some more messages, we can see
`Admin Console Storage Collections` view automatically update with the new content, just like the other application window.

== Chat Android Application


Demo application we deployed to LiveOak in a previous chapter configured LiveOak services to provide REST endpoints for `chat-html`.

We will create another mobile application that will communicate with those same server endpoints, but will run as a native application on Android.

For this demo we’ll be using link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Cloud_Messaging[Google Cloud Messaging (GCM)].
GCM is natively supported on most Android devices, and allows native applications to receive messages sent to the device even when it
had no data connectivity, or was turned off. It also makes it possible for a native application to be ‘woken up’ when a message arrives
 - even if an application may not be running at that moment.

LiveOak provides the necessary REST endpoints for message dispatching. It uses link:http://aerogear.org/push[AeroGear UnifiedPush Server]
component to perform the actual native cloud messaging dispatch. link:http://aerogear.org/push[AeroGear UnifiedPush Server] supports
not only GCM, but also link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Push_Notification_Service[Apple Push Notification Service],
and in the future possibly other cloud messaging providers. That makes it possible to dispatch messages to many different native platforms
without having to write, and deploy as much as a single line of application specific server-side code.


=== Installing AeroGear UnifiedPush Server (UPS)

To set up link:http://aerogear.org/push[AeroGear UnifiedPush Server] download `unifiedpush-server-0.10.3.war`, and `unifiedpush-h2-ds.xml`
 datasource file, as instructed link:https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-unifiedpush-server/blob/master/README.md[here].

Stop your LiveOak server, and deploy the files in it - $JBOSS refers to the same directory as $LIVEOAK.

Restart LiveOak, and point your browser to link:http://localhost:8080/unifiedpush-server-0.10.3[]

image::guides/ups_login.png[AeroGear UnifiedPush Server]

Use `admin` : `123` to log in.

Next, use link:https://console.developers.google.com/project[Google Developers Console] to configure a new GCM application as
instructed link:http://aerogear.org/docs/guides/aerogear-push-android/google-setup/[here].


=== Setting Up Chat App in AaroGear UPS

Now we have to return to link:http://localhost:8080/unifiedpush-server-0.10.3[UPS Admin Console], and create a new application.

image::guides/ups_applications.png[AeroGear UPS Applications]

Click `Create ...` button, type `liveoak-chat` for an application name, and click `Create` again.

image::guides/ups_create_application.png[AeroGear UPS Create Application]

Click on `liveoak-chat` application name.

image::guides/ups_liveoak_chat_added.png[AeroGear UPS liveoak-chat added]

And in application screen add a new `Variant`, call it `liveoak-chat-android`

image::guides/ups_chat_variants.png[AeroGear UPS Variants]

Then fill in `Google API Key`, and `Project Number` with values from link:https://console.developers.google.com/project[Google Developers Console].

image::guides/ups_chat_add_variant.png[AeroGear UPS Add Variant]

Thus far we have configured GCM support in link:https://console.developers.google.com/project[Google Developers Console],
and configured link:http://localhost:8080/unifiedpush-server-0.10.3[AeroGear UnifiedPush Server] to use Google’s GCM services for our application.

We still have to configure our `chat-html` LiveOak application to talk to link:http://localhost:8080/unifiedpush-server-0.10.3[AeroGear UPS].


=== Setting Up Chat App in LiveOak

In link:http://localhost:8080/admin#/applications/chat-html[LiveOak Admin Console] for `chat-html`
(link:http://localhost:8080/admin#/applications/chat-html[]) select `Push` in the left navigation bar.

image::guides/chat_html_admin_push.png[Chat HTML Admin Push]

Enter `Application ID`, and `Master Secret` from link:http://localhost:8080/unifiedpush-server-0.10.3[AeroGear UPS] console.
For `AeroGear Unified Push URL` enter: `http://localhost:8080/unifiedpush-server-0.10.3`, and save changes.

image::guides/chat_html_admin_push_config.png[Chat HTML Admin Push Configuration]

Now it’s time to build a native Android client.


=== Preparing Chat Android App for Build

Before we can build our `Chat` Android application we need `Android SDK` installed.

If you don’t have it installed yet, follow the link:/docs/guides/installing_android[instructions here] to install the necessary tools.

Next, open `$LIVEOAK_EXAMPLES/chat/chat-android` project in an IDE, and make some necessary modifications to the code as explained
link:https://github.com/liveoak-io/liveoak-examples/tree/master/chat/chat-android#building-the-example[here].


Use `Project Number` of `chat-android` application in link:https://console.developers.google.com/project[Google Developers Console] as `GCM_SENDER_ID`.

We’ll assume now that you have link:/docs/guides/installing_android[Android SDK] installed, and that `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable points to a directory where it is installed.
We'll also assume that you have $ANDROID_HOME/tools, and $ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools on your PATH, and that you also have link:/docs/guides/installing_ant[Apache Ant] installed.

Let’s go to `chat-android` directory:

`cd $LIVEOAK_EXAMPLES/chat/chat-android`


For this project we use `Gradle` build tool, which is the new official `Android SDK` build system.

Ideally `Gradle` would use whatever Android build tools you have installed on your system, but that's not the case, so we have to
perform another step before we can finally build our Chat for Android.


Our `Gradle` build script requires `Android Build Tools` version 19.1.0. If you followed link:/docs/guides/installing_android[Android SDK installation instructions],
then you are all set. Otherwise, if you don't have the correct tools version you can install them into your `Android SDK` with this command:

`sudo $ANDROID_HOME/tools/android -s update sdk -u -a -t 'build-tools-19.1.0'`


Another option is to instruct `Gradle` to use another version of `Android Build Tools` already installed in your `Android SDK`.

To see which version of build-tools you have issue this command:

`ls $ANDROID_HOME/build-tools`

Take note of the highest version that you have e.g. 19.0.2.

Then, open `app/build.gradle`, find the line containing `buildToolsVersion`, and set its value to your version.


Now we can build the project:

`./gradlew assemble`


After successful build, install the created archive to a running emulator or connected physical device:

`$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools/adb install -r app/build/apk/app-debug-unaligned.apk`

=== Troubleshoot

==== Where is Android app on my phone?

Look for a green application icon with a title 'LiveOak Chat'

==== Android app shows error message and exits

Most likely reason is that the application can't connect to the server. Try the following steps to resolve connectivity issues.

Open a web browser on your device, and point it to link:http://IP_ADDRESS:8080/chat-html[] where `IP_ADDRESS` is a local
network address where your LiveOak instance is running.

You can determine that address by running:

`ifconfig`


If you can't get to Chat web application this way, make sure you start your LiveOak instance using `-b 0.0.0.0`:

`$LIVEOAK/bin/standalone.sh -b 0.0.0.0`

If you have a firewall enabled, make sure it permits inbound connections to port 8080 - a simple way is to temporarily turn it off.


If remote access to Chat web application works, then make sure the changes you made to `ChatApplication.java` correctly specify the IP_ADDRESS and port:

`UPS_URL = "http://IP_ADDRESS:8080/unifiedpush-server-0.10.3"`
`LIVEOAK_HOST = "IP_ADDRESS"`
`LIVEOAK_PORT = 8080`


Then, another possibility is that you missed one or more of the configuration steps.

Check link:http://localhost:8080/admin#/applications/chat-html/push[LiveOak Admin Push configuration page], and make sure it has all the fields
filled out, and has a Connected status.

You may also re-check link:http://localhost:8080/unifiedpush-server-0.10.3[AeroGear UPS configuration] and compare values with those in
link:https://console.developers.google.com/project[Google Developers Console] to make sure all is properly configured.


==== Android app seems to be working, but does not receive any messages

Try to completely uninstall any previous version of 'LiveOak Chat' from your device / emulator, and reinstall it again.

Chat application uses 'Google Cloud Messaging' (GCM) to receive messages from LiveOak server. It uses `aerogear-android` library
which caches some GCM related information that may become invalid when application is reconfigured through 'LiveOak UPS Admin'.

Uninstalling, and reinstalling the application will clean any such information.


==== Android app is working, but receives all messages twice

Reinstalling 'LiveOak Chat' may result in multiple different GCM registration ids for the same device. 'AeroGear UPS' will dispatch messages to all
registered GCM registration ids. 'LiveOak Chat' should probably detect such situation, and unregister redundant old registration ids.

link:http://localhost:8080/unifiedpush-server-0.10.3/#/mobileApps[AeroGear UPS Admin] can be used to disable individual
GCM registration ids - also called 'Device Tokens'. That can be done in administration page for `liveoak-chat-android` variant.
