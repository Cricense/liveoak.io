link:http://keycloak.org[Keycloak] is used by LiveOak project to handle security and authentication of users. By default, LiveOak contains
embedded Keycloak instance to have admin console and examples working without too much additional efforts. However in some cases, you may need
to use separate Keycloak instance instead of the embedded one. In this case, you can follow these instructions:

In next steps, I assume that your LiveOak will be running on http://localhost:8080 and your separate Keycloak will be running on
http://localhost:8081 .

== Keycloak setup

First run Keycloak server.

Then login as `admin` into Keycloak admin console and go to http://localhost:8081/auth/admin/master/console/#/realms/master/applications .
Then click to `Add Application` and add application like this:

* Name: `console`
* Access type: `public`
* 2 redirect URIs with values http://localhost:8080/admin and http://localhost:8080/admin/
* Then click `Save` button

Now when Application is created, you can configure:

* Base URL: http://localhost:8080/admin/
* Web origins: http://localhost:8080

Then you need to create `liveoak-apps` realm

* Go to http://localhost:8081/auth/admin/master/console/#/realms/master and click on `Add Realm`
* Fill name `liveoak-apps`
* On page http://localhost:8081/auth/admin/master/console/#/realms/liveoak-apps/login-settings you may need to check `User Registration`
to enable registration of new users in `liveoak-apps` realm

== LiveOak setup

First delete file `$LIVEOAK_HOME/standalone/deployments/auth-server.war` and `$LIVEOAK_HOME/standalone/deployments/auth-server.war.dodeploy` to ensure
that embedded Keycloak is not deployed within LiveOak.

Then edit file `$LIVEOAK_HOME/apps/admin/console/js/app.js` and change particular part of the file when `liveOak` object is configured to look like this:

[source]
var liveOak = new LiveOak({
  auth: {
    url: 'http://localhost:8081/auth',
    realm: 'master',
    clientId: 'console',
    onload: 'login-required'
  }
});

{empty} +

Also edit file `$LIVEOAK_HOME/conf/extensions/keycloak.js` and edit `keycloak-url` property to look like:

[source]
keycloak-url: 'http://localhost:8081/auth',

{empty} +

After doing these, you can go to http://localhost:8080/admin and enjoy LiveOak admin console secured by external Keycloak from localhost:8081

[source]
Note: These instructions work without issues with latest LiveOak master and will work from LiveOak Alpha-03 .

== Securing LiveOak applications

In most cases, you just need to follow the README for each application. There is not much differences between the default setup (embedded Keycloak)
and external Keycloak setup. Only things to keep in mind are especially:

* In your application, you need to change the place where liveOak object is created and add the property `url` to the `auth` part.
The line with the value of property URL will be like this:
[source]
url: 'http://localhost:8081/auth',

{empty} +
For example in `chat-html-secured` application, you need to add the line here https://github.com/liveoak-io/liveoak-examples/blob/master/chat/chat-html-secured/app/chat.js#L8
so the whole part with `auth` object will look like this:
[source]
auth: {
  url: 'http://localhost:8081/auth',
  clientId: 'chat-html-secured-client',
  realm: 'liveoak-apps'
}

{empty} +
Similarly for other example application. Most example applications are designed in a way that creation of liveOak object is at only one place. So you need to change just this one place.

* Make sure that when you're creating client, you won't use relative redirect URI like `/chat-html-secured/\*` but you will always use redirect URIs with whole
domain part like for example `http://localhost:8080/chat-html-secured/*` . Relative URI can be used just in case that Keycloak
and LiveOak are on same host, which is not the case with external Keycloak.

* Make sure that when you're creating client, you will always configure Web Origins with the LiveOak host. Usually value of Web Origin will be like `http://localhost:8080` .
Web Origins are normally not needed with default setup (embedded Keycloak) as in that case both LiveOak and Keycloak have same origin.
But with external Keycloak, you always need to add Web Origin. See details link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing[here] .
