Gallery application is a simple image gallery allowing browsing and uploading of photos.

It demonstrates LiveOak's binary data storage capabilities.

Gallery application comes in two forms:

* As an link:https://https://github.com/liveoak-io/liveoak-examples/tree/master/gallery[HTML web application]

* As an link:https://github.com/liveoak-io/liveoak-examples/tree/master/gallery-cordova[Android application] - implemented using
 Apache Cordova, which means it's essentially the same as HTML web application, only slightly modified, and repackaged as a native Android application.


== Gallery Web Application

Let’s start by deploying `$LIVEOAK_EXAMPLES/gallery` to 'LiveOak' first. This will not only deploy static web content to be served by 'LiveOak',
but also configure the necessary 'LiveOak' services ('mongo-gridfs' service for example) as REST endpoints used by both Gallery web, and Android applications.

=== Installation

There are two ways that the gallery application can be installed:

1. Manually
+
To deploy the application simply copy `gallery` directory to 'LiveOak' application deployment directory:
+
  cp -r $LIVEOAK_EXAMPLES/gallery $LIVEOAK_HOME/apps/
+
And start 'LiveOak':
+
 $LIVEOAK_HOME/bin/standalone.sh -b 0.0.0.0
+
NOTE: By using -b 0.0.0.0 we make 'LiveOak' endpoints available on all network interfaces so that they can be accessed from mobile devices within your local network.
+
2. LiveOak Admin Console
+
Start LiveOak:
+
 $LIVEOAK_HOME/bin/standalone.sh -b 0.0.0.0
+
Point your browser to link:http://localhost:8080/admin#/example-applications[], select `Gallery` and then `Install`.

=== Usage

Point your browser to link:http://localhost:8080/gallery/app/index.html[].

You should see a simple photo gallery application, that allows you to upload images to 'LiveOak'.

By using a '+' button in bottom right corner you can upload new images to the server.

You can access the web application from your Android device by going to that same link - except instead of `localhost` use an
ip address of your 'LiveOak' server instance.

Android Chrome browser offers various options when adding a new image.

Selecting `Documents` opens a file picker activity.

Exact looks and functionality of file picker component used depend on what software is installed on the device.

== Gallery for Android using Cordova

link:http://cordova.apache.org[Cordova] is an open source project under the umbrella of Apache organization, that provides
a framework for using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript to create cross-platform native mobile applications.

We’ll build and run `$LIVEOAK_EXAMPLES/gallery-cordova` example to demonstrate how to use 'Cordova' for a mobile client, and 'LiveOak' for a server.

For server endpoints we’ll depend on `gallery` HTML application from previous chapter, so make sure you have that one
up and running.


Now we’re going to build `gallery-cordova`. But first, we need to install the necessary tools.

'Cordova' uses 'node.js' based build system, and comes as a set of 'Node Package Manager (npm)' packages.

Follow the link:/docs/guides/installing_cordova[instructions here] to install 'Cordova' on your system.

Once you have Cordova tools on your system install 'Cordova' into our project.

[source]
cd $LIVEOAK_EXAMPLES/gallery-cordova
mkdir platforms plugins
cordova plugin add org.apache.cordova.inappbrowser
cordova plugin add org.apache.cordova.camera
cordova plugin add org.apache.cordova.file

{empty} +

Make sure you have link:/docs/guides/installing_android[Android SDK] installed as described link:/docs/guides/installing_android[here],
and that you have ANDROID_HOME environment variable set, and have $ANDROID_HOME/tools, and $ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools on your PATH:

`export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools`

Then, configure project for 'Android' build:

`cordova platform add android`


It's now time to connect your device via USB, or run an Android emulator instance.

This last step will build an Android application, and install it on your device / emulator.

`cordova run android`


You should see 'Gallery' application start on your device / emulator.

Thanks to `org.apache.cordova.file` plugin 'Gallery' application can use a native image picker activity.
