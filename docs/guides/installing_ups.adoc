To set up link:http://aerogear.org/push[AeroGear UnifiedPush Server] do the following.

Download UnifiedPush Server .war, and a WildFly datasource configuration file:

`curl -L http://dl.bintray.com/aerogear/AeroGear-UnifiedPush/org/jboss/aerogear/unifiedpush/unifiedpush-server/0.10.3/unifiedpush-server-0.10.3.war -o ~/Downloads/unifiedpush-server-0.10.3.war`

`curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aerogear/aerogear-unifiedpush-server/0.10.x/databases/unifiedpush-h2-ds.xml -o ~/Downloads/unifiedpush-h2-ds.xml`

Also download a dependency .jar that's required to get it all working inside LiveOak distribution:

`curl http://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=org/codehaus/jackson/jackson-xc/1.9.13/jackson-xc-1.9.13.jar -o ~/Downloads/jackson-xc-1.9.13.jar`


Now stop your 'LiveOak' server if it's running.

Explode the .war into `deployments` directory.

`mkdir $LIVEOAK/standalone/deployments/unifiedpush-server-0.10.3.war`

`cd $LIVEOAK/standalone/deployments/unifiedpush-server-0.10.3.war`

`unzip ~/Downloads/unifiedpush-server-0.10.3.war`

Add a dependency jar:

`cp ~/Downloads/jackson-xc-1.9.13.jar $LIVEOAK/standalone/deployments/unifiedpush-server-0.10.3.war/WEB-INF/lib/`

Create .dodeploy file

`touch $LIVEOAK/standalone/deployments/unifiedpush-server-0.10.3.war.dodeploy`

And finally deploy the datasource file

`cp ~/Downloads/unifiedpush-h2-ds.xml $LIVEOAK/standalone/deployments/`


Restart 'LiveOak', and point your browser to link:http://localhost:8080/unifiedpush-server-0.10.3[]
