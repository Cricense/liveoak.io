This is a famous link:http://todomvc.com[ToDoMVC] example implemented using LiveOak as a backend. It uses storage service, but
also demonstrates basic security configuration - creating users, and using roles to restrict access to particular task lists.


'TodoMVC' application comes in two forms:

* As a link:https://https://github.com/liveoak-io/liveoak-examples/tree/master/todomvc[HTML web application]

* As an link:https://github.com/liveoak-io/liveoak-examples/tree/master/todomvc-cordova[Android application] - implemented using
 Apache Cordova.


== TodoMVC Web Application

Let’s start by deploying $LIVEOAK_EXAMPLES/todomvc to LiveOak. This will make static web content available, but also configure
the necessary LiveOak services as REST endpoints.

=== Installation

There are two ways that the todomvc application can be installed:

1. Manually
+
To deploy the application simply copy `todomvc` directory to LiveOak application deployment directory:
+
  cp -r $LIVEOAK_EXAMPLES/todomvc $LIVEOAK_HOME/apps/
+
And start LiveOak:
+
 $LIVEOAK_HOME/bin/standalone.sh -b 0.0.0.0
+
NOTE: By using -b 0.0.0.0 we make LiveOak endpoints available on all network interfaces so that they can be accessed from mobile devices within your local network.
+
2. LiveOak Admin Console
+
Start LiveOak:
+
 $LIVEOAK_HOME/bin/standalone.sh -b 0.0.0.0
+
Point your browser to link:http://localhost:8080/admin#/example-applications[], select `TodoMVC` and then `Install`.

=== Usage

Point your browser to link:http://localhost:8080/todomvc[].

We would expect to see the 'todomvc' web application. But instead we get the following screen:

image::guides/todomvc_first_login.png[TodoMVC - First Login, 75%, align="center"]

The reason is that the application is configured through link:https://github.com/liveoak-io/liveoak-examples/blob/master/todomvc/application.json[application.json]
file to require authentication for all access - it doesn't allow any anonymous access, but we have not configured the login mechanism through
link:http://localhost:8080/admin[LiveOak Admin Console] yet.

Let's configure security by pointing the browser to link:http://localhost:8080/admin[].

We are met with a login form. Use `admin` as username and a password - unless you changed it to something else already.

image::guides/admin_login.png[LiveOak Admin - Log In, 75%, align="center"]

If this is the first time you're logging into link:http://localhost:8080/admin[LiveOak Admin Console], you'll have to change the password.

image::guides/admin_update_password.png[LiveOak Admin - Update password, 75%, align="center"]

link:http://localhost:8080/admin[LiveOak Admin Console] has quite a short idle timeout, so you may have to login again quite often.

After successful login you find yourself on 'Applications' admin page.

image::guides/admin_applications.png[LiveOak Admin - Applications, 75%, align="center"]

Select `todomvc` application to open the dashboard, then select the `Security` icon in the left sidebar and select the `Roles` tab. Application currently has no Roles configured.

image::guides/todomvc_security_roles.png[LiveOak Admin - Application Settings, 75%, align="center"]

Use `New Role` button to add two roles named `admin`, and `user`.

Then make `user` role active by default for new users.

image::guides/todomvc_security_roles_toggle_default_role.png[LiveOak Admin - Toggle default role, 75%, align="center"]

Switch from `Security` to `Clients` in left sidebar.

image::guides/todomvc_application_clients.png[LiveOak Admin - Application Clients, 75%, align="center"]

Use `New Client` button to add a new client configuration.

image::guides/todomvc_application_clients_new.png[LiveOak Admin - New Application Client, 75%, align="center"]

Set `todomvc-html-client` as a 'Client Name'.

For 'Platform' click `HTML5` icon.

Specify a single 'Redirect URI': `http://localhost:8080/todomvc/*`, and specify `http://localhost:8080` for 'Web Origins'.

Finally, check both `admin`, and `user` role for 'Scope'. And click `Save`.


If you now try again link:http://localhost:8080/todomvc[] you'll get a working Login screen.

image::guides/todomvc_working_login.png[TodoMVC - Login, 75%, align="center"]


At this point we don't have any users yet, but we do have registration of new users available on the Login page. This allows anyone to
register as a regular user - one with `user` role automatically assigned.

But we want to create an 'admin' user for our application first.

Let's go back to the link:http://localhost:8080/admin[LiveOak Admin Console] and open the `Security` section for `todomvc`.

Select the `Users` tab

image::guides/todomvc_security_users.png[LiveOak Admin Console - Users, 75%, align="center"]

And use `New User` button to create a new user. Enter new 'Username', a temporary password and click `Save`. The user will have to change the password on a first login.

image::guides/todomvc_security_users_add.png[LiveOak Admin Console - Add User, 75%, align="center"]

At this point our user `bob` can login to link://localhost:8080/todomvc[], and access the web application.

image::guides/todomvc_bob.png[TodoMVC, 75%, align="center"]

'You might get an error message here. Let's just ignore it for now.'

Thus far `bob` is a regular user, which means he can create new todo items, and list, edit, or delete todo items that he himself has created.

We can make him an 'admin' which will allow him full access to any other user's items as well.

Let's go back to link:http://localhost:8080/admin[LiveOak Admin Console] again, and go to `Users` tab of `Security` for `todomvc`.
`bob` will be present in the list of users.

image::guides/todomvc_security_users_all.png[LiveOak Admin Console - View all users, 75%, align="center"]

Select `bob` to edit the user, and select `user` and `admin` for `Roles`. Click `Save`.

image::guides/todomvc_security_users_roles.png[LiveOak Admin Console - Assigned Roles, 75%, align="center"]

While here, repeat the steps, and create two more users. User `john` which should only have `user` role assigned,
and user `alice` which should have no roles assigned at all - i.e. should have a default `user` role removed from 'Assigned Roles' list.

Don't forget to set their temporary passwords.


Now, let's login to link:http://localhost:8080/todomvc[TodoMVC] as user `bob` again, and create one todo item.

image::guides/todomvc_bob_first_todo.png[Bob's first Todo, 75%, align="center"]

Then log out, and login as `john`. And create a new item.

image::guides/todomvc_john.png[John's first Todo, 75%, align="center"]

Note that John only sees his own items.

Log out, and login as `bob` again.

image::guides/todomvc_see_all_bob.png[Bob the admin, 75%, align="center"]

You can see that Bob can read all existing todo items from all users. He can also edit, and delete any item he wants.

Now try to login as `alice`.

Since `alice` has no roles, she has no access to application functions, even though she was allowed to log in.



== TodoMVC for Android using Cordova

link:http://cordova.apache.org[Cordova] is an open source project under the umbrella of Apache organization, that provides
a framework for using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript to create cross-platform native mobile applications.

We’ll build and run `$LIVEOAK_EXAMPLES/todomvc-cordova` example to demonstrate how to use 'Cordova' for mobile client, and LiveOak for a server.

For server endpoints we’ll depend on `todomvc` HTML application from previous chapter, so make sure to first get that one
up and running.


Now we’re going to build `todomvc-cordova`.

If you don't have 'Cordova' installed on your system yet follow the link:/docs/guides/installing_cordova[instructions here] to install it.

Now, let's build our `todomvc-cordova` application.

[source]
cd $LIVEOAK_EXAMPLES/todomvc-cordova
rm -rf platforms
rm -rf plugins
mkdir platforms plugins
cordova plugin add org.apache.cordova.inappbrowser

{empty} +

Make sure you have link:/docs/guides/installing_android[Android SDK] installed according to instruction link:/docs/guides/installing_android[here].
And that you have ANDROID_HOME environment variable set, and have $ANDROID_HOME/tools, and $ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools on your PATH:

`export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools`

Then, configure project for Android build:

`cordova platform add android`


It's now time to connect your device via USB, or run an Android emulator instance.

This last step will build an Android application, and install it on your device / emulator.

`cordova run android`


You should see 'TodoMVC' application start on your device / emulator.

image::guides/todomvc_android_login.png[TodoMVC Android - Login, 75%, align="center"]

When you login as 'bob' or 'john' you see the same list of items as if logged in through a web browser.
