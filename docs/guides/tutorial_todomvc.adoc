= Demo TodoMVC application

This is a famous link:http://todomvc.com[ToDoMVC] example implemented using LiveOak as a backend. It uses storage service, but
also demonstrates basic security configuration - creating users, and using roles to restrict access to particular task lists.


TodoMVC application comes in two forms:

* As a link:https://https://github.com/liveoak-io/liveoak-examples/tree/master/todomvc[HTML web application]

* As an link:https://github.com/liveoak-io/liveoak-examples/tree/master/todomvc-cordova[Android application] - implemented using
 Apache Cordova.


== TodoMVC Web Application

Let’s start by deploying liveoak-examples/todomvc to LiveOak. This will make static web content available, but also configure
the necessary LiveOak services as REST endpoints.

To deploy the application copy `todomvc` directory to LiveOak application deployment directory:

`cp -r liveoak-examples/todomvc $LIVEOAK/apps/`

And start LiveOak:

`$LIVEOAK/bin/standalone.sh -b 0.0.0.0`


Point your browser to link:http://localhost:8080/todomvc[].

We would expect to see todomvc web application. But instead we get the following screen:

image::guides/todomvc_first_login.png[]

The reason is that the application is configured through link:https://github.com/liveoak-io/liveoak-examples/blob/master/todomvc/application.json[application.json] file to require authentication for all
access - it doesn't allow any anonymous access, but we have not configured the login mechanism through link:http://localhost:8080/admin[LiveOak Admin Console] yet.

Let's configure security by pointing the browser to link:http://localhost:8080/admin[].

We are met with a login form. Use admin:admin as username:password.

image::guides/admin_login.png[LiveOak Admin - Log In]

If this is the first time you're logging into link:http://localhost:8080/admin[LiveOak Admin Console], you'll have to change the password.

image::guides/admin_update_password.png[LiveOak Admin - Update password]

link:http://localhost:8080/admin[LiveOak Admin Console] has quite a short idle timeout, so you may have to login again quite often.

After successful login you find yourself on 'Applications' admin page.

image::guides/admin_applications.png[LiveOak Admin - Applications]

Click `Edit Settings` icon button. Application currently has no Roles configured.

image::guides/admin_application_settings.png[LiveOak Admin - Application Settings]

Use `Add Role` button to add two roles named `admin`, and `user`.

Then make `user` role active by default for new users.

image::guides/admin_application_settings_toggle_default_role.png[LiveOak Admin - Toggle default role]

Click `Save` and switch from `General Settings` section to `Clients` section.

image::guides/admin_application_clients.png[LiveOak Admin - Application Clients]

Use `Add Client` button to add a new client configuration.

image::guides/admin_application_new_client.png[LiveOak Admin - New Application Client]

Set `todomvc-html-client` as a 'Client Name'.

For 'Platform' click `HTML5` icon.

Specify a single 'Redirect URI': `http://localhost:8080/todomvc/*`, and use the suggested value for 'Web Origins'.

Make sure to click 'Add' for these two.

Finally, check both `admin`, and `user` role for 'Scope'. And click `Save`.


If you now try again link:http://localhost:8080/todomvc[] you'll get a working Login screen.

image::guides/todomvc_working_login.png[TodoMVC - Login]


At this point we don't have any users yet, but we do have registration of new users available on the Login page. This allows anyone to
register as a regular user - one with `user` role automatically assigned.

But we want to create an 'admin' user for our application first.

Let's log into link:http://localhost:8080/auth[KeyCloak Admin Console] at link:http://localhost:8080/auth[]

image::guides/keycloak_admin.png[KeyCloak Admin Console]

Select `Administration Console`, then use `admin` as username - the same as for link:http://localhost:8080/admin[LiveOak Admin Console].

When logged in select `liveoak-apps` realm in top navigation.

image::guides/keycloak_admin_apps.png[KeyCloak Admin Console]

Now go to `Users` section

image::guides/keycloak_admin_app_users.png[KeyCloak Admin Console - Users]

And use `Add User` button to create a new user. Enter new 'Username' and click `Save`.

image::guides/keycloak_admin_add_user.png[KeyCloak Admin Console - Add User]

Then switch to `Credentials` tab, and specify a temporary password. The user will have to change the password on a first login.

image::guides/keycloak_admin_reset_password.png[KeyCloak Admin Console - Reset Password]

At this point our user `bob` can login to link://localhost:8080/todomvc[], and access the web application.

image::guides/todomvc_bob.png[TodoMVC]

'You might get an error message here. Let's just ignore it for now.'

Thus far `bob` is a regular user, which means he can create new todo items, and list, edit, and delete todo items that he himslef has created.

We can make him an 'admin' which will allow him full access to any other user's items as well.

Let's go back to link:http://localhost:8080/auth/admin[KeyCloak Admin Console] again, and go to `Users` section of `liveoak-apps` realm, and click `View all users` to
list all current users.

image::guides/keycloak_view_all_users.png[KeyCloak Admin Console - View all users]

Select `bob`, and switch to `Role Mappings` tab.

image::guides/keycloak_role_mappings.png[KeyCloak Admin Console - Role Mappings]

Under 'Application Roles' select `todomvc`.

Then move `admin` from 'Available Roles' list to 'Assigned Roles' list.

image::guides/keycloak_assigned_roles.png[KeyCloak Admin Console - Assigned Roles]

While here, repeat the steps, and create two more users. User `john` which should only have `user` role assigned,
and user `alice` which should have no roles assigned at all - i.e. should have a default `user` role removed from 'Assigned Roles' list.

Don't forget to set their temporary passwords via `Credentials` tab.


Now, let's login to link:http://localhost:8080/todomvc[TodoMVC] as user `bob` again, and create one todo item.

image::guides/todomvc_bob_first_todo.png[Bob's first Todo]

Then log out, and login as `john`. And create a new item.

image::guides/todomvc_john.png[John's first Todo]

Note that John only sees his own items.

Log out, and login as `bob` again.

image::guides/todomvc_see_all_bob.png[Bob the admin]

You can see that Bob can read all existing todo items from all the users. He can also edit, and delete any item he wants.

Now try to login as `alice`.

Since `alice` has no roles, she has no access to application functions, even though she was allowed to log in.



== TodoMVC for Android using Cordova

link:http://cordova.apache.org[Cordova] is an open source project under the umbrella of Apache organization, that provides
a framework for using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript to create cross-platform native mobile applications.

We’ll build and run `liveoak-examples/todomvc-cordova` example to demonstrate how to use Cordova for mobile client, and LiveOak for a server.

For server endpoints we’ll depend on `liveoak-examples/todomvc` HTML application from previous chapter, make sure to first get that one
up and running.


Now we’re going to build `liveoak-examples/todomvc-cordova`.

If you don't have Cordova installed on your system yet follow the link:/docs/guides/installing_cordova[instructions here] to install it.

Now, let's build our todomvc-cordova application.

`cd liveoak-examples/todomvc-cordova`
`rm -rf platforms`
`rm -rf plugins`
`mkdir platforms plugins`
`cordova plugin add org.apache.cordova.inappbrowser`


Make sure you have ANDROID_HOME environment variable set, and have ANDROID_HOME/tools, and ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
on your PATH:

`export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools`

Then, configure project for Android build:

`cordova platform add android`


It's now time to connect your device via USB, or run an Android emulator instance.

This last step will build an Android application, and install it on your device / emulator.

`cordova run android`


You should see TodoMVC application start on your device / emulator.
