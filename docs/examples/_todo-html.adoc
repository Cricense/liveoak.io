==== ToDo (HTML)

This example will make static web content available to be served by LiveOak, but also configure the necessary LiveOak services
as REST endpoints.

The source for this example is located at https://github.com/liveoak-io/liveoak-example-todomvc

===== Installation

Start LiveOak:
[source,bash]
----
$LIVEOAK_HOME/bin/standalone.sh -b 0.0.0.0
----

Point your browser to http://localhost:8080/admin#/example-applications[], select `TodoMVC` and then `Install`.

===== Usage

Point your browser to http://localhost:8080/todomvc[].

We would expect to see the 'todomvc' web application. But instead we get the following screen:

image::examples/todomvc_first_login.png[TodoMVC - First Login, 75%, align="center"]

The reason is that the application is configured through the
https://github.com/liveoak-io/liveoak-example-todomvc/blob/master/application.json[application.json]
file to require authentication for all access - it doesn't allow any anonymous access, but we have not configured the login
mechanism through the http://localhost:8080/admin[LiveOak Admin Console] yet.

Let's configure security by pointing the browser to http://localhost:8080/admin[].

We are met with a login form. Use `admin` as username and a password - unless you changed it to something else already.

If this is the first time you're logging into the http://localhost:8080/admin[LiveOak Admin Console], you'll have to
change the password.

The http://localhost:8080/admin[LiveOak Admin Console] has quite a short idle timeout, so you may have to login again quite often.

After successful login you find yourself on the 'Applications' admin page.

Select `todomvc` application to open the dashboard, then select the `Security` icon in the left sidebar and select the `Roles`
tab. The application currently has no Roles configured.

image::examples/todomvc_security_roles.png[LiveOak Admin - Application Settings, 75%, align="center"]

Use the `New Role` button to add two roles named `admin`, and `user`.

Then make the `user` role active by default for new users.

image::examples/todomvc_security_roles_toggle_default_role.png[LiveOak Admin - Toggle default role, 75%, align="center"]

Switch from `Security` to `Clients` in the left sidebar.

image::examples/todomvc_application_clients.png[LiveOak Admin - Application Clients, 75%, align="center"]

Use the `New Client` button to add a new client configuration.

image::examples/todomvc_application_clients_new.png[LiveOak Admin - New Application Client, 75%, align="center"]

Set `todomvc-html-client` as a 'Client Name'.

For 'Platform' select `HTML5`.

Specify a single 'Redirect URI': `http://localhost:8080/todomvc/*`, and specify `http://localhost:8080` for 'Web Origins'.

Finally, check both `admin`, and `user` role for 'Scope', and click `Save`.

If you now try again to access http://localhost:8080/todomvc[], you will get a working Login screen.

image::examples/todomvc_working_login.png[TodoMVC - Login, 75%, align="center"]

At this point we don't have any users yet, but we do have registration of new users available on the Login page. This allows
anyone to register as a regular user - one with `user` role automatically assigned.

But we want to create an 'admin' user for our application first.

Let's go back to the http://localhost:8080/admin[LiveOak Admin Console] and open the `Security` section for `todomvc`.

Select the `Users` tab

image::examples/todomvc_security_users.png[LiveOak Admin Console - Users, 75%, align="center"]

And use the `New User` button to create a new user. Enter new 'Username', a temporary password and click `Save`. The user will
have to change the password on a first login.

image::examples/todomvc_security_users_add.png[LiveOak Admin Console - Add User, 75%, align="center"]

At this point our user `bob` can login to http://localhost:8080/todomvc[], and access the web application.

image::examples/todomvc_bob.png[TodoMVC, 75%, align="center"]

'You might get an error message here. Let's just ignore it for now.'

Thus far `bob` is a regular user, which means he can create new todo items, and list, edit, or delete todo items that he
himself has created.

We can make him an 'admin', which will allow him full access to any other user's items as well.

Let's go back to the http://localhost:8080/admin[LiveOak Admin Console] again, and go to `Users` tab of `Security` for `todomvc`.
`bob` will be present in the list of users.

image::examples/todomvc_security_users_all.png[LiveOak Admin Console - View all users, 75%, align="center"]

Select `bob` to edit the user, and select `user` and `admin` for `Roles`. Click `Save`.

image::examples/todomvc_security_users_roles.png[LiveOak Admin Console - Assigned Roles, 75%, align="center"]

While here, create two more users. User `john`, which should only have `user` role assigned,
and user `alice`, which should have no roles assigned at all - i.e. should have a default `user` role removed from
'Assigned Roles' list.

Don't forget to set their temporary passwords.

Now, let's login to http://localhost:8080/todomvc[TodoMVC] as user `bob` again, and create one todo item.

image::examples/todomvc_bob_first_todo.png[Bob's first Todo, 75%, align="center"]

Then log out, and login as `john`. And create a new item.

image::examples/todomvc_john.png[John's first Todo, 75%, align="center"]

Note that John only sees his own items.

Log out, and login as `bob` again.

image::examples/todomvc_see_all_bob.png[Bob the admin, 75%, align="center"]

You can see that Bob can read all existing todo items from all users. He can also edit, and delete any item he wants.

Now try to login as `alice`.

Since `alice` has no roles, she has no access to application functions, even though she was allowed to log in.
