==== Gallery (HTML)

This example will not only deploy static web content to be served by LiveOak, but also configure the necessary LiveOak
services ('mongo-gridfs' for example) as REST endpoints which are used by both the HTML and Cordova UIs.

The source for this example is located at https://github.com/liveoak-io/liveoak-example-gallery

===== Installation

Start LiveOak:
[source,bash]
----
$LIVEOAK_HOME/bin/standalone.sh -b 0.0.0.0

Point your browser to link:http://localhost:8080/admin#/example-applications[], select `Gallery` and then `Install`.

ip address of your LiveOak server instance.
