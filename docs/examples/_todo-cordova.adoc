=== ToDo (Cordova)

http://cordova.apache.org[Cordova] is an open source project under the umbrella of the Apache organization, that provides
a framework for using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript to create cross-platform native mobile applications.

For the server endpoints, we depend on the `todo` HTML application, so make sure you have it up and running.

The source for this example is located at https://github.com/liveoak-io/liveoak-example-todomvc-cordova

If you don't have Cordova installed on your system yet, follow the link:/docs/install/cordova[instructions here] to install it.

Now weâ€™re going to build `todomvc-cordova`.

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/liveoak-io/liveoak-example-todomvc-cordova
cd liveoak-example-todomvc-cordova
rm -rf platforms
rm -rf plugins
mkdir platforms plugins
cordova plugin add org.apache.cordova.inappbrowser
----

Make sure you have the link:/docs/install/android[Android SDK] installed, the ANDROID_HOME environment variable set,
and you have $ANDROID_HOME/tools, and $ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools on your PATH:

[source,bash]
----
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
----

Then, configure the project for 'Android' build:

[source,bash]
----
cordova platform add android
----

It's now time to connect your device via USB, or run an Android emulator instance.

This last step will build an Android application, and install it on your device / emulator.

[source,bash]
----
cordova run android
----

You should see 'TodoMVC' application start on your device / emulator.

When you login as 'bob' or 'john' you see the same list of items as if logged in through a web browser.
