==== Chat (Android)

The chat application we deployed to LiveOak earlier, configured LiveOak services to provide REST endpoints for `chat-html`.

Now we will create another mobile application that will communicate with those same server endpoints, but will run as a native
application on Android.

For this demo we’ll be using https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Cloud_Messaging[Google Cloud Messaging (GCM)].
GCM is natively supported on most Android devices, and allows native applications to receive messages sent to the device even
when the device has no data connectivity, or was turned off when messages were sent to it. It also makes it possible for a
native application to be ‘woken up’ when a message arrives - even if an application may not be running at that moment.

LiveOak provides the necessary REST endpoints for message dispatching. It uses the http://aerogear.org/push[AeroGear UnifiedPush Server]
component to perform the actual native cloud messaging dispatch. http://aerogear.org/push[AeroGear UnifiedPush Server] supports
not only GCM, but also https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Push_Notification_Service[Apple Push Notification Service]. That
makes it possible to dispatch messages to many different native platforms without having to write, and deploy, as much as a
single line of application specific server-side code.

The source for this example is located at https://github.com/liveoak-io/liveoak-example-chat-android

===== Installing AeroGear UnifiedPush Server (UPS)

Note: These instructions will be updated with the latest version of AeroGear UPS, once it has been verified.

We assume that the 'AeroGear UnifiedPush Server' is installed into the LiveOak server, and listens at http://localhost:8080/unifiedpush-server-0.10.3.

Follow the link:/docs/install/ups[instructions here] to download, and install 'AeroGear UPS' so that it can be accessed this way.

This is not the only way to install 'AeroGear UPS'. It could live in its own application server instance on a different port,
and a different URL, or it could be deployed on OpenShift. LiveOak can use 'AeroGear UPS' regardless of its host, or port, as
long as its REST APIs are accessible. But deploying it differently than into LiveOak server may make it more difficult for you
to follow this document, as all the URLs referring to 'AeroGear UPS' will be incorrect.

Before continuing, make sure that you have followed the instructions to configure a 'Google Cloud Messaging' application via
'Google Developers Console'.

===== Setting Up Chat Application in AeroGear UPS

Now we browse to http://localhost:8080/unifiedpush-server-0.10.3[UPS Admin Console], and create a new application.

image::ups/applications.png[AeroGear UPS Applications, 75%, align="center"]

Click `Create ...` button, type `liveoak-chat` for an application name, and click `Create` again.

image::ups/create_application.png[AeroGear UPS Create Application, 75%, align="center"]

Click on the `liveoak-chat` application name.

image::ups/liveoak_chat_added.png[AeroGear UPS liveoak-chat added, 75%, align="center"]

In the application screen, add a new `Variant` (using the 'Add...' button), calling it `liveoak-chat-android`.

image::ups/chat_variants.png[AeroGear UPS Variants, 75%, align="center"]

Fill in the `Google API Key`, and `Project Number` with values from the https://console.developers.google.com/project[Google Developers Console].

image::ups/chat_add_variant.png[AeroGear UPS Add Variant, 75%, align="center"]

Thus far we have configured GCM support in https://console.developers.google.com/project[Google Developers Console],
and configured the http://localhost:8080/unifiedpush-server-0.10.3[AeroGear UnifiedPush Server] to use Google’s GCM services for
our application.

We still have to configure our `chat-html` LiveOak application to talk to http://localhost:8080/unifiedpush-server-0.10.3[AeroGear UPS]
before messages will be pushed to our device.

===== Setting Up Chat Application in LiveOak

In the http://localhost:8080/admin#/applications/chat-html[LiveOak Admin Console] for `chat-html` select `Push` in the left
navigation bar.

image::examples/chat_html_admin_push.png[Chat HTML Admin Push, 75%, align="center"]

Enter the `Application ID`, and `Master Secret` from the http://localhost:8080/unifiedpush-server-0.10.3[AeroGear UPS console].
Enter the `AeroGear UnifiedPush URL` as: `http://localhost:8080/unifiedpush-server-0.10.3`, and save changes.

Now it’s time to build a native Android client.

===== Preparing Chat Android Application for Build

Before we can build our `Chat` Android application, we need the `Android SDK` installed.

If you don’t have it installed yet, follow the link:/docs/install/android[instructions here] to install the necessary tools.

Once installed, we need to clone the project source:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/liveoak-io/liveoak-example-chat-android.git
----

After cloning, we need to make modifications to the code that are explained
https://github.com/liveoak-io/liveoak-example-chat-android#building-the-example[here].

Use `Project Number` of the `chat-android` application in https://console.developers.google.com/project[Google Developers Console] as `GCM_SENDER_ID`.

Let’s go to the project directory:

[source,bash]
----
cd liveoak-example-chat-android
----

For this project we use the `Gradle` build tool.

Ideally `Gradle` would use whatever Android build tools you have installed on your system, but that's not the case, so we have to
perform another step before we can finally build our Chat for Android.

Our `Gradle` build script requires `Android Build Tools` version 19.1.0. If you followed
link:/docs/install/android[Android SDK installation instructions], then you are all set. Otherwise, if you don't have the
correct tools version you can install them into your `Android SDK` with this command:

[source,bash]
----
sudo $ANDROID_HOME/tools/android -s update sdk -u -a -t 'build-tools-19.1.0'
----

Another option is to instruct `Gradle` to use another version of `Android Build Tools` already installed in your `Android SDK`.

To see which version of build-tools you have issue this command:

[source,bash]
----
ls $ANDROID_HOME/build-tools
----

Take note of the highest version that you have e.g. 19.0.2

Then, open `app/build.gradle`, find the line containing `buildToolsVersion`, and set its value to your version.

Now we can build the project:

[source,bash]
----
gradle clean build
----

After successful build, install the created archive to a running emulator or connected physical device:

[source,bash]
----
$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools/adb install -r app/build/apk/app-debug-unaligned.apk
----

===== Troubleshooting

====== Where is the application on my phone?

Look for a green application icon with a title 'LiveOak Chat'.

====== Application shows error message and exits

The most likely reason is that the application can't connect to the server. Try the following steps to resolve connectivity issues.

Open a web browser on your device, and point it to http://IP_ADDRESS:8080/chat-html where `IP_ADDRESS` is a local
network address where your LiveOak instance is running.

You can determine that address by running:

[source,bash]
----
ifconfig
----

If you can't get to the Chat web application this way, make sure you start your LiveOak instance using `-b 0.0.0.0`:

[source,bash]
----
$LIVEOAK_HOME/bin/standalone.sh -b 0.0.0.0
----

If you have a firewall enabled, make sure it permits inbound connections to port 8080 - a simple fix is to temporarily turn it off.

If remote access to the Chat web application works, then make sure the changes you made to `ChatApplication.java` correctly
specifies the IP_ADDRESS and port:

[source,bash]
----
UPS_URL = "http://IP_ADDRESS:8080/unifiedpush-server-0.10.3"
LIVEOAK_HOST = "IP_ADDRESS"
LIVEOAK_PORT = 8080
----

Then, another possibility is that you missed one or more of the configuration steps.

Check http://localhost:8080/admin#/applications/chat-html/push[LiveOak Admin Push configuration], and make sure it has all the fields
filled out, and has a Connected status.

You may also re-check http://localhost:8080/unifiedpush-server-0.10.3[AeroGear UPS console] and compare values with those in
https://console.developers.google.com/project[Google Developers Console] to make sure all is properly configured.

====== Application seems to be working, but does not receive any messages

Try to completely uninstall any previous version of 'LiveOak Chat' from your device / emulator, and reinstall it again.

Chat application uses 'Google Cloud Messaging' (GCM) to receive messages from LiveOak. It uses the `aerogear-android` library
which caches some GCM related information that may become invalid when application is reconfigured through 'LiveOak UPS Admin'.

Uninstalling, and reinstalling the application will clean any such information.

====== Application is working, but receives all messages twice

Reinstalling 'LiveOak Chat' may result in multiple different GCM registration ids for the same device. 'AeroGear UPS' will
dispatch messages to all registered GCM registration ids. 'LiveOak Chat' should probably detect such situation, and unregister
redundant old registration ids.

http://localhost:8080/unifiedpush-server-0.10.3/#/mobileApps[AeroGear UPS Admin] can be used to disable individual
GCM registration ids - also called 'Device Tokens'. That can be done in the administration page for the `liveoak-chat-android`
variant.
