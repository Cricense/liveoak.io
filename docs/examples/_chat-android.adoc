==== Chat (Android)

The chat application we deployed to LiveOak earlier, configured LiveOak services to provide REST endpoints for `chat-html`.

Now we will create another mobile application that will communicate with those same server endpoints, but will run as a native
application on Android.

For this demo we’ll be using https://developer.android.com/google/gcm/index.html[Google Cloud Messaging (GCM)].
GCM is natively supported on most Android devices, and allows native applications to receive messages sent to the device even
when the device has no data connectivity, or was turned off when messages were sent to it. It also makes it possible for a
native application to be ‘woken up’ when a message arrives - even if an application may not be running at that moment.

LiveOak provides the necessary REST endpoints for message dispatching. It uses the http://aerogear.org/push[AeroGear UnifiedPush Server]
component to perform the actual native cloud messaging dispatch. http://aerogear.org/push[AeroGear UnifiedPush Server] supports
not only GCM, but also 
https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/Chapters/ApplePushService.html[Apple Push Notification Service].
That makes it possible to dispatch messages to many different native platforms without having 
to write, and deploy, as much as a single line of application specific server-side code.

The source for this example is located at https://github.com/liveoak-io/liveoak-example-chat-android

===== AeroGear UnifiedPush Server (UPS) Configuration

In order to use the Android chat example you will need to have access to a UPS instance. Please note that you cannot install 
UPS into the same server as LiveOak. Your UPS instance will have to be installed in a different server, either locally
or network accessible. Please see the https://aerogear.org/push/[AeroGear UPS website] for installation instructions.

There is nothing unique which needs to be done specifically for LiveOak when configuring an Android based application in the
UPS console. It's the exact same steps as configuring any other Android application in UPS, which comes down to two main steps:


====== Setting up a Google Messaging Project

You will first need to setup a Google Cloud Messaging project in the 
https://console.developers.google.com[Google Developer Console]. Instructions for setting up your project can be found 
https://aerogear.org/docs/unifiedpush/aerogear-push-android/google-setup/[here] in the AeroGear documention.


====== Setting up a Google Based UPS Application

Once you have your project setup in the Google Developer Console, you will then need to create a Google based
application in UPS. Instructions for setting up your application can be found 
https://aerogear.org/docs/unifiedpush/aerogear-push-android/register-device/[here] in the AeroGear documentation.


===== Setting Up Chat Application in LiveOak

From your UPS console you will need to open your Android application. You should then be presented with a page which
displays the `Server URL`, `Application ID` and `Master Secret`

image::examples/chat_html_UPS_console.png[UPS Console, 75%, align="center"]

In the http://localhost:8080/admin#/applications/chat-html[LiveOak Admin Console] for `chat-html` select `Push` in the left
navigation bar.

image::examples/chat_html_admin_push.png[Chat HTML Admin Push, 75%, align="center"]

Here you will need to enter the `AeroGear UnifiedPush URL`, `Application ID`, and `Master Secret` that you obtained from the 
UPS console.

Now it’s time to build a native Android client.

===== Preparing Chat Android Application for Build

Before we can build our `Chat` Android application, we need the `Android SDK` installed.

If you don’t have it installed yet, follow the link:/docs/install/android[instructions here] to install the necessary tools.

Once installed, we need to clone the project source:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/liveoak-io/liveoak-example-chat-android.git
----

After cloning, we need to make modifications to the code that are explained
https://github.com/liveoak-io/liveoak-example-chat-android#building-the-example[here].

All the data for filling out the liveoak.json file can be found in your variant's page in the UPS console. Please note that the 
`gcm-sender-id` is equal to the `Project Number` seen in the UPS console:

image::examples/chat_android_ups_variant.png[UPS Console Variant, 75%, align="center"]

Let’s go to the project directory:

[source,bash]
----
cd liveoak-example-chat-android
----

For this project we use the `Gradle` build tool.

Ideally `Gradle` would use whatever Android build tools you have installed on your system, but that's not the case, so we have to
perform another step before we can finally build our Chat for Android.

Our `Gradle` build script requires `Android Build Tools` version 19.1.0. If you followed
link:/docs/install/android[Android SDK installation instructions], then you are all set. Otherwise, if you don't have the
correct tools version you can install them into your `Android SDK` with this command:

[source,bash]
----
sudo $ANDROID_HOME/tools/android -s update sdk -u -a -t 'build-tools-19.1.0'
----

Another option is to instruct `Gradle` to use another version of `Android Build Tools` already installed in your `Android SDK`.

To see which version of build-tools you have issue this command:

[source,bash]
----
ls $ANDROID_HOME/build-tools
----

Take note of the highest version that you have e.g. 19.0.2

Then, open `app/build.gradle`, find the line containing `buildToolsVersion`, and set its value to your version.

Now we can build the project:

[source,bash]
----
gradle clean build
----

After successful build, install the created archive to a running emulator or connected physical device:

[source,bash]
----
$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools/adb install -r app/build/apk/app-debug-unaligned.apk
----

===== Troubleshooting

====== Where is the application on my phone?

Look for an application called `LiveOak Chat`. It should look something like:

image::examples/chat_html_homescreen_icon.png[Android Chat Icon, 50%, align="center"]

====== Application shows error message and exits

The most likely reason is that the application can't connect to the server. Try the following steps to resolve connectivity issues.

Open a web browser on your device, and point it to http://IP_ADDRESS:8080/chat-html where `IP_ADDRESS` is a local
network address where your LiveOak instance is running.

You can determine that address by running:

[source,bash]
----
ifconfig
----

If you can't get to the Chat web application this way, make sure you start your LiveOak instance using `-b 0.0.0.0`:

[source,bash]
----
$LIVEOAK_HOME/bin/standalone.sh -b 0.0.0.0
----

If you have a firewall enabled, make sure it permits inbound connections to port 8080 - a simple fix is to temporarily turn it off.

If remote access to the Chat web application works, then make sure the changes you made to `ChatApplication.java` correctly
specifies the IP_ADDRESS and port:

[source,bash]
----
UPS_URL = "http://IP_ADDRESS:8080/unifiedpush-server-0.10.3"
LIVEOAK_HOST = "IP_ADDRESS"
LIVEOAK_PORT = 8080
----

Then, another possibility is that you missed one or more of the configuration steps.

Check http://localhost:8080/admin#/applications/chat-html/push[LiveOak Admin Push configuration], and make sure it has all the fields
filled out, and has a Connected status.

You may also re-check http://localhost:8080/unifiedpush-server-0.10.3[AeroGear UPS console] and compare values with those in
https://console.developers.google.com/project[Google Developers Console] to make sure all is properly configured.

====== Application seems to be working, but does not receive any messages

Try to completely uninstall any previous version of 'LiveOak Chat' from your device / emulator, and reinstall it again.

Chat application uses 'Google Cloud Messaging' (GCM) to receive messages from LiveOak. It uses the `aerogear-android` library
which caches some GCM related information that may become invalid when application is reconfigured through 'LiveOak UPS Admin'.

Uninstalling, and reinstalling the application will clean any such information.

====== Application is working, but receives all messages twice

Reinstalling 'LiveOak Chat' may result in multiple different GCM registration ids for the same device. 'AeroGear UPS' will
dispatch messages to all registered GCM registration ids. 'LiveOak Chat' should probably detect such situation, and unregister
redundant old registration ids.

http://localhost:8080/unifiedpush-server-0.10.3/#/mobileApps[AeroGear UPS Admin] can be used to disable individual
GCM registration ids - also called 'Device Tokens'. That can be done in the administration page for the `liveoak-chat-android`
variant.
