==== Gallery (Cordova)

link:http://cordova.apache.org[Cordova] is an open source project under the umbrella of the Apache organization, that provides
a framework for using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript to create cross-platform native mobile applications.

For the server endpoints, we depend on the `gallery` HTML application, so make sure you have it one up and running.

The source for this example is located at https://github.com/liveoak-io/liveoak-example-gallery-cordova

Now weâ€™re going to build `gallery-cordova`. But first, we need to install the necessary tools.

Cordova uses a 'node.js' based build system, and comes as a set of 'Node Package Manager (npm)' packages.

Follow the link:/docs/install/cordova[instructions here] to install 'Cordova' on your system.

Once you have the Cordova tools on your system, install 'Cordova' into our project as follows:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/liveoak-io/liveoak-example-gallery-cordova
cd liveoak-example-gallery-cordova
mkdir platforms plugins
cordova plugin add org.apache.cordova.inappbrowser
cordova plugin add org.apache.cordova.camera
cordova plugin add org.apache.cordova.file
----

Make sure you have link:/docs/install/android[Android SDK] installed, the ANDROID_HOME environment variable set,
and have $ANDROID_HOME/tools, and $ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools on your PATH:

[source,bash]
----
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
----

Then, configure the project for 'Android' build:

[source,bash]
----
cordova platform add android
----

It's now time to connect your device via USB, or run an Android emulator instance.

This last step will build an Android application, and install it on your device / emulator.

[source,bash]
----
cordova run android
----

You should see 'Gallery' application start on your device / emulator.

Thanks to the `org.apache.cordova.file` plugin, our 'Gallery' example can use a native image picker activity.
