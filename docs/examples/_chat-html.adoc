[[ex-chat-html]]
==== Chat (HTML)

This example utilize some basic services from LiveOak, such as storage and subscriptions, and serve the static content that
constitutes the single page application of the example.

The source for this example is located at https://github.com/liveoak-io/liveoak-example-chat-html

===== Installation

Start LiveOak:
[source,bash]
----
$LIVEOAK_HOME/bin/standalone.sh -b 0.0.0.0
----

Point your browser to http://localhost:8080/admin#/example-applications[], select `HTML Chat` and then `Install`.

===== Usage

Point your browser to http://localhost:8080/chat-html[].

You should see a simple chat web application. Enter some text as if you were Alice:

Open http://localhost:8080/chat-html[] in another window, side by side with the first, type some text in there and send it.
You should see the sent text display in both windows instantly.

This example is a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application[single page application] - it provides static HTML,
javascript, and CSS content which is served by LiveOak as simple static files. This is configured through the
link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liveoak-io/liveoak-example-chat-html/master/application.json[application.json] configuration
file, which instructs LiveOak what ready-made services to expose through REST for this application.

Serving of static files is one of these services. Another is persistent storage backed by `MongoDB`.

Keep in mind that this example does not contain any application specific server-side logic - all the javascript files are for
a client browser, not for the server, yet the application stores chat messages on the server, and broadcasts content updates to
other clients through server. All thanks to the out-of-the-box services that LiveOak provides.

We can use the http://localhost:8080/admin[LiveOak Admin Console] to configure application resources, and browse application
data on the server. Let’s go to http://localhost:8080/admin[]

Log in as user `admin` - use the same for a password. The first time you try to login to the http://localhost:8080/admin[LiveOak Admin Console]
you will be asked to set a new password.

You should now find yourself on the `Dashboard` page of the `chat-html` application.

To browse application data select `Storage` in the left navigation bar.

image::examples/chat_html_admin_storage.png[Chat HTML - Admin Storage, 75%, align="center"]

We can see that we have one storage resource configured, bound to `/storage` subroot of `/chat-html`, and using the `Default Datastore`
for `MongoDB`.

Where did this configuration come from?
It is specified in the `$LIVEOAK_HOME/apps/chat-html/application.json` file which serves as a master configuration file for the application.

We can create storage resources directly through the http://localhost:8080/admin[LiveOak Admin Console] as well, but for now let's browse
through `chat-html` application’s data created thus far.

Click on storage resource title text `storage` - in green.

image::examples/chat_html_admin_storage_collections.png[Chat HTML - Admin Storage Collections, 75%, align="center"]

We can browse the data, and search through it. If we switch again to application page, and send some more messages, we can see the
`Admin Console Storage Collections` view automatically update with the new content, just like the other application window before.
