      %p 
        LiveOak is a backend-as-a-service stack that simplifies
        development for mobile and standard web clients. Its goal
        is to enable client-side access to traditional backend
        services without having to write server-side code.
      %p
        LiveOak's fundamental architectural approach is REST to
        the core. LiveOak provides publish/subscribe,
        push-to-the-mobile-client, and REST-based APIs to shuffle data between
        mobile handsets, traditional desktops, and other servers in a local
        cluster or in the cloud.

      fluently and provides seamless integration with Vert.x modules.  Exposing
      your existing Vert.x data through the LiveOak REST API works over the
      Vert.x event bus, allowing all of your Vert.x modules to play along.
