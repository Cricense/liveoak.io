        LiveOak provides a number of backend services for your applications. Here they are.

    %h2 Filesytem
    %p 
      The filesystem resource service makes it easy to serve up
      files from a filesystem to provide the HTML, Javascript, CSS
      images, and other artifacts required by an application.
  
    %h2 Aggregating Filesystem
    %p
      The aggregating filesystem resource uses special descriptors
      to aggregate several files into a single resource to be served.
      Its usage is not unlike the Rails asset-pipeline, able to stitch
      together many Javascript, CSS and other files together as a 
      single addressable resource.

    %h2 Security and Policies (OAuth)

    %h2 MongoDB
    %p 
      The Mongo resource service exposes typical CRUD operations on
      MongoDB databases, collections, and objects. 

    %h2 Scheduler
    %p 
      The scheduler resource service exposes a way to schedule triggers.
      When the trigger executes, the server will invoke an HTTP call to
      another end-point specified when the trigger is created.  Additionally
      clients can subscribe to the executions of a given trigger, allowing
      them to also be triggered.
